## Usage

    [pomodoro]
    command=python ~/path-to-repo/i3-pomodoro/pomodoro.py
    interval=1


## Configuration

You can change the output, stage durations, actions on mouse clicks and the amount of stages.
The default configuration should be fine for most people, but feel free to hack it to your taste.

To loop automatically just change the `next_stage` property of the rest stage.
