Putting the qute in qutebrowser!

qutenyan is a [[https://github.com/TeMPOraL/nyan-mode][nyan-mode]] "plugin" for [[https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser][qutebrowser]], displaying and controlling
scroll position in webpages.

* Important Warning

qutenyan uses undocumented qutebrowser APIs to overwrite qutebrowser internal
state. This means its prone to break and may cause qutebrowser crashes. Use at your
own risk!

When the plugin api gets exposed, I will port this to the plugin api.

* Installation

qutenyan uses the ~config.py~ system to (improperly) inject itself into
qutebrowser. It will replace the ~scroll~ widget in ~statusbar.widgets~ with a nyan
instead (so it should work on a default installation).

1. Clone this repo into your configuration directory
   - See [[http://qutebrowser.org/doc/help/configuring.html][the configuration docs for more information]]. The directory can be
     found in the output of ~:version~.
     #+BEGIN_SRC sh
       git clone https://gitlab.com/jgkamat/qutenyan.git ~/.config/qutebrowser/qutenyan
     #+END_SRC

   - If you manage your config with git, you should add a submodule to this repo instead.
2. Add this line to your ~config.py~
   #+BEGIN_SRC python
     # point this to where you cloned qutenyan
     config.source('qutenyan/nyan.py')
   #+END_SRC
3. Enjoy your new nyan!

* Troubleshooting

1. If you see an empty space where the nyan should be, please make sure you have
   the svg qt module installed. On Arch, this is [[https://www.archlinux.org/packages/extra/x86_64/qt5-svg/][qt5-svg]].

* Configuration

Right now, there's only one configuration option, a ~NYAN_WIDTH~ constant at
the top of the file. If you have a better idea for how to expose configuration
options (or options you want exposed), please let me know.

For more traditional nyan scrollbars, please [[https://gist.github.com/olmokramer/5eabbce5dfbfbdafcbcbd497b02ffb17][use this user stylesheet]]!

Please report bugs or feature requests to this repository, and happy nyan-ing!
