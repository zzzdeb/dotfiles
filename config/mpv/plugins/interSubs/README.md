interSubs
=========

Interactive subtitles for [mpv](https://github.com/mpv-player/mpv), that was made to help study languages.  
Easily tweaked and customizable.

v. 2.8 - Changelog at the bottom.  
If Qt version doesn't work for you - use [Tk](https://github.com/oltodosel/interSubs/tree/master/Tk). It is abandoned, but still works.

Requirements
------------
   * mpv 0.27 (I don't know if it will work with mpv front-ends.)
   * python => 3.6
   * pyqt5 (pip/pacman/etc)
   * composite manager; xcompmgr or sth.
   * numpy (pip/pacman/etc)
   * beautifulsoup4 (pip/pacman/etc)
   * requests (pip/pacman/etc)
   * python-lxml
   * lua
   * socat
   * pkill
   * xdotool (for hiding subtitles when minimizing mpv or switching window) 
   * optional: chromium (for external translation, other browser can be specified)
   * optional: wget (for listening to pronunciation)

Installation
------------
* `mv interSubs.py interSubs.lua interSubs_config.py ~/.config/mpv/scripts/;`
* Edit configuration file interSubs_config.py
* Edit interSubs.lua to add option where interSubs will start automatically. 
* For Mac also edit configuration at interSubs.lua
* On KDE(kwin) go to composite and uncheck "Allow applications to block compositing". [Screenshot](https://iwf1.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/Disable-applications-override-compositor-KDE.jpg).
* For Windows - port it yourself.

Usage
-----
* Start video with mpv & select subtitles.
* F5 to start/stop interSubs.
	* Starts automatically with files/paths specified in interSubs.lua
* Point cursor over the word to get popup with translation.
* F6 to hide/show without exiting.

Buttons bellow may be reassigned in config
-----
* Click on the word to look it up on another translator in the browser.
* Right-click on the word to hear its pronunciation.
* Wheel - scroll through transitions in popup.
* Wheel+Ctrl - resize subtitles.
* Wheel+Shift - change subtitles' vertical position.
* Wheel-click - cycle through auto_pause options.
* Wheel-click-left/right - +/- auto_pause_min_words. (fancy mouses)
* Back-click - translate whole sentence. (fancy mouses)

Important
-----
* May have issues working in a multi-monitor system.
* On KDE subtitles might sometimes be invisible. See [the solution](https://github.com/oltodosel/interSubs/issues/12#issuecomment-433960146).
* Instead of changing system settings you may change [--x11-bypass-compositor](https://mpv.io/manual/stable/#options-x11-bypass-compositor)
* Stuttering video during subtitles change might be solved by changing mpv's video output `mpv --vo gpu`.
